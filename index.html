		<h1>How To Coffee</h1>
		<p>
			This is a step-by-step guide on how Jake makes coffee
			using the french press.
		</p>
		<div id="main-container" class="cards">
			<div id="step1" class="stepcard">
				<h2 class="steptitle">1:Fill The Kettle</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Fill to the Max Fill line inside
						the Kettle.
					</li>
					<li>Use the best water avaliable.</li>
					<li>
						Press both the On/Off and the
						Hold Button.
					</li>
					<li>
						This should take about 5
						Minutes.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div id="step2" class="stepcard">
				<h2 class="steptitle">
					2:Weigh and Grind Beans
				</h2>
				<ul>
					<li class="steptitle">
						The Ratio is "1 gram coffee to
						17 grams water".
					</li>
					<li>
						As of 2/13/2022: Jake has been
						using ~42 grams of coffee.
					</li>
					<li>
						Weigh on the scale in a bowl.
						Make sure to zero out the scale
						with the empty bowl on it before
						you weigh the beans.
					</li>
					<li>
						Turn on the grinder first and
						then dump in the bean. This
						improves the life of the
						burrs...or something.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div id="step3" class="stepcard">
				<h2 class="steptitle">3:Start Brewing</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Add ground coffee to the empty
						french press.
					</li>
					<li>
						The water should be boiling or
						about 210 degrees Fahrentheit.
						The brew temp you want is
						between 205 and 195.
					</li>
					<li>
						At the ratio of 1 to 17: 42
						grams of coffee should have 731
						grams of water.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div id="step4" class="stepcard">
				<h2>4: Stop Brewing</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Brewing will take ~4 Minutes.</li>
					<li>
						When four minutes have elapsed.
						Stir the top several time. It
						doens't have to be excessive.
						Just send the grounds to the
						bottom.
					</li>
					<li>
						Skim the foam at the top as best
						you can/feel like that day.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div id="step5" class="stepcard">
				<h2>5:Let it sit.</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Let the coffee sit for another 4
						minutes or so.
					</li>
					<li>
						This allows the smaller grounds
						to sink to the bottom.
					</li>
					<li>
						It is unclear how much the step
						matters.
					</li>
					<li>
						I usually just go until the milk
						frother stops.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div id="step6" class="stepcard">
				<h2>6:Pour</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						James Hoffman says no press, and
						just sort of strains it with the
						lid part.
					</li>
					<li>
						I press because why not. I don't
						think it affects too many fines.
					</li>
					<li>
						I typically pour Jake's cup
						first. Holly's current mug is
						slightly smaller and therefore
						should look like it has a little
						more in it.
					</li>
					<li>
						Top with frothed milk and serve.
					</li>
				</ul>
